# Overview

While the **ARINC 424** specification describes entities (or records) with 132-byte fixed-length string, this library creates a database object model via building entities using reflection and runtime compilation.

Most terms are converted according to the specification into associated enumerations or numeric values ​​on the fly.

In addition, relationships between entities are established after the building stage.

In practice, this allows you to explore and manipulate the tree-like representation of **ARINC 424** database.

See [docs](https://malstraem.github.io/arinc424.net) to know how specification is mapped.
