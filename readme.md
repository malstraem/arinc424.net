# Overview

While the `ARINC424` format describes entities (*or records*) with 132-byte fixed-length string, this library creates 
a database object model at load time via building entities using reflection. Most terms are converted according 
to the specification into associated enums or numeric values on the fly.

In addition, relationships between entities are established after the building stage.

In practice, this allows you to explore and manipulate the tree-like representation of `ARINC424` database.

# State and plans

After the finalization of the primary records, the error handle and log during parsing will be introduced to guarantee 
that as many objects and relationships as possible will be created from the strings.
